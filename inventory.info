Sophia takes the coins and tells us:
Eliza and her are reasearch sahagin.  Complicated race.  Differenct cultures depending on part of the sea/world
Sahagin are kind of rare.  live 125-150 years.  In the sea of swords, they have been known to mingle with landfolk.
These sahagin are who she wants to study.  What are their customs, beliefs, emotions, sciences, arts.  Most can't
speak sahagin. She's met two sahagins one didn't talk at all just dipped out.  The second one, Zoog, is a mercenary/
pirate.  Large spear weilding pirate that is a skilled combatant.  Leaps onto boats from the sea.  Takes his payment
in gold and hides it in the ocean. Zoog fights an Aboleth and establishes himself as a hero amongst the Zakara.
The writer of these stories, Hyohh, ten coins 50 years old.  Wyrr the sand comber creates art in the sand at night,
Denn, 5 coins 20 years old.

Baron kills the elf from Denns story.  The Elf was in love with a sahagin and was killed.  Baron wanted it to be
known that whomever loved the elf should know not.  

Hanging out with Nyerhite Verther for 8 gold over the 10 day trip
He's moving fancy silks that have been eaten by worms.  I notice this, but I doesn't show him.

A few days into our trip, we ran into an overturned card.  Faced off against 6 hobgoblins and 1 big bad bitch hobgob.
Whipped that ass and are heading through the fields of the dead to continue our long journey to Waterdeep.
